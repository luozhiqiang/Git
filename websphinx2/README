WebSPHINX version 0.5
-------------------------

WebSPHINX is a Java class library and interactive development
environment for Web crawlers. A Web crawler (also called a robot or
spider) is a program that browses and processes Web pages
automatically.

This source code is distributed under the terms of an Apache-style
license.

WebSPHINX depends on two other packages available only in binary form:

        * gd/graph graph-drawing package by Daniel Tunkelang
        * symantec.itools.awt package by Symantec Visual Cafe

Class files for these packages (but not Java source files) are
distributed in this archive for the purpose of recompiling WebSPHINX.


Recompiling WebSPHINX
-------------------------

(Note: the archive contains precompiled class files, so you don't need
to recompile WebSPHINX unless you change its source.)


1. Get the netscape.* packages from an installation of Netscape
4.0 or later.  (It's possible to compile WebSPHINX without the
netscape packages, so you can skip this step.  You'll get compile
errors from two source files, but otherwise WebSPHINX will run fine
under the JDK.)

The netscape packages are included in java40.jar, which can usually be
found in one of the following locations:

     Unix:    <netscape-directory>/java/java40.jar
                     or
              <netscape-directory>/java/classes/java40.jar

     Windows: <netscape-directory>\Program\Java\Classes\java40.jar

Extract the netscape.* packages into your websphinx directory:

     jar xvf <netscape-path>/java40.jar netscape

Be careful not to extract *all* the classes in java40.jar, since java40.jar
also includes standard java packages (e.g. java.lang.*) that you don't want.


2. Compile WebSPHINX:

   2(a) If you have GNU make, just run 

                gmake

        to recompile all source files using the makefile. The makefile
        depends on gmake features, so ordinary make won't work.  The
        result of the make will be a new jar file, websphinx.jar.

        Then run Websphinx using

                java -jar websphinx.jar

   2(b) If you don't have GNU make, compile all Java files by hand, e.g.:

                javac websphinx/*.java \
                      websphinx/workbench/*.java \
                      websphinx/searchengine/*.java

        Then set your classpath to point to src/ and lib/, and run

                java websphinx.workbench.Workbench
